   <h3>From the garage to the Googleplex</h3>
   </p>
   <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University.</strong><br><strong>Larry Page</strong>was
      considering Stanford for grad school and <strong>Sergry Brin,</strong> a student there, was assigned to show him
      around.</p>
   <p> <small> By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during the first meeting,but by the following
         year they struck a <span style="color: violet;">partnership</span>.</small> <br> <small>Working from their dorm
         rooms, they build a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the <span
            style="color: turquoise;">World Wide Web.</span> </small></p>
   <p><small>They called this search engine <em><span style="color: yellowgreen;">Backrub</span></em> </small></p>
