        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University</b>. <br>
            <b><em>Larry Page</em></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><em>Sergey Brin</em></b>, a student
            there, was assigned to show him around.
        </p>
        <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
            year they struck a <i style="background: yellow;">partnership</i>.<br>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
            individual pages on the <b style="color: indigo;">World Wide Web</b> .
        </p>
        <p>They called this search engine <i style="background: lightblue">Backrub</i>.</p>
