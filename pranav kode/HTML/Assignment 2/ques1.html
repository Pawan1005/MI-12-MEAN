        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University</b>.<br>
            <b><i>Larry Page</i></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><i>Sergey Brin</i></b>, a student
            there, was assigned to show him around.

            By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
            year they struck a <span style="background-color: yellow;">partnership</span>.<br>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
            individual pages on the <span style="color: blue;">World Wide Web</span>.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px;">
            They called this search engine <i style="background-color:skyblue">Backrub</i>.
