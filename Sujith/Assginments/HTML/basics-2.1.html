		<h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
		<p class="content-1">The Google story begins in 1995 at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.<br/><i>Larry Page</i> was considering Stanford for grad school and <i>Sergey Brin</i>, a student there, was assigned to show him around.</p>
		<p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following year they struck <mark>partnership</mark>.<br/>Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
		<p>They called this search engine <i class="italic">Backrub</i>.</p>
